# Network Admin Lab

Welcome! This is my personal lab for preparing for Linux/Network/System Administration roles.

This portfolio contains small, practical setups and documentation that reflect skills required in real-world infrastructure roles — including topics like VPN configuration, firewall rules, monitoring, and change management.

## What This Lab Covers

- VPN & Secure Remote Access (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec)
-  Basic firewall & router configurations (iptables, MikroTik)
-  Network monitoring (PRTG, Prometheus, Grafana)
-  Network routing & switching concepts (STP, NAT, VLANs)
-  Change management documentation (mock ITIL)
-  Network & infrastructure diagrams
-  Infrastructure hardening (fail2ban, SSH security)
-  Inventory & IP address tracking (IPAM)

## Technologies Used

Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky), MikroTik RouterOS, PRTG, Prometheus, Grafana, Nginx, WireGuard, Docker, Draw.io
